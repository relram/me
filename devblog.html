            It's been a few days since I've updated the blog. I've been focusing on reading and already
            breaking my rule of writing some code every day. I'm trying to get this contact form to work
            a certain way and am almost there. I guess this is what it's like building something for the first time.
            I don't want to just copy and paste code or something like that. All the kids have been sick too. Alright,
            that's enough excuses. Back to work!

        <p id="postContent">Today's been a lot of learning and reading, so the code I'm writing is this post. It's not a lot, but I did practice my Emmit.
            Been reading on The Odin Project about more in depth CSS and HTML. Soon I'll be exploring more JavaScript and will add more functionality to this site.

                so that there is some variety. I edited and restyled the name form on the home page. Now the form clears when submit is hit and the greeting
                replaces it. I think it makes it nice and clean. I need to edit the blog style some more but it's decent for now.

        <p id="postContent">Today's work was all behind-the-scenes. On my home page, you can enter your name and it greets you, returning your name.
            Now, those greetings come from an array that I wrote in JavaScript. Also, I've written all this quite quickly using Emmit in VS Code. 
            I watched some videos and read articles by way of The Odin Project. So a lot of learning, a little code, and a very busy day.

            page and blog pages. On a behind the scenes note, I organized my files and folders for better use.

        <p id="postContent">Hey everyone. This is the first post in my 100 Days of Code Dev blog. My plan is to document the things I do and learn over the next 100 days.
            I started this site from scratch using HTML and CSS. I used Visual Code to write it and GitHub to publish it using Pages. I learned how to display an image 
            as a circle as well as use .hover in CSS to change the color of the border around the picture when hovered over. The color scheme I picked was from Canva. 
            I like the shades of blue with black and white. I think it looks good. I also added a neat little JavaScript app on the home page that returns input for a
            greeting to any guest of the site.
