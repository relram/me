        <p id="postContent">Today's addition is this blog! I added a blog page and created a template for posting. I also made a navigation bar and linked the home
            page and blog pages. On a behind the scenes note, I organized my files and folders for better use.

        <p id="postContent">Hey everyone. This is the first post in my 100 Days of Code Dev blog. My plan is to document the things I do and learn over the next 100 days.
            I started this site from scratch using HTML and CSS. I used Visual Code to write it and GitHub to publish it using Pages. I learned how to display an image 
            as a circle as well as use .hover in CSS to change the color of the border around the picture when hovered over. The color scheme I picked was from Canva. 
            I like the shades of blue with black and white. I think it looks good. I also added a neat little JavaScript app on the home page that returns input for a
            greeting to any guest of the site.
